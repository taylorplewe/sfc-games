# Taylor's list of notable Super Famicom games

I made this because the number of Super Famicom games never released in the US that looked interesting to me kept growing and growing, and I couldn't keep track of what the games actually were other than a little description when I wrote them down. I'd write down "Otogiriso" but have no idea two weeks later what that game even looked like.
